# Reflection on Kanban Board Implementation

## Challenges in Selecting and Customizing the Template
Selecting the right GitHub project template for my system was a bit challenging at first. I had to consider which template would best suit the Agile methodology I was applying to the system. After exploring different options, I chose the **Automated Kanban** template because it includes built-in automation that supports sprint tracking. This was important for ensuring that tasks could be moved automatically based on their status, which aligns with the Agile principle of continuous progress.

Customizing the template was straightforward, but I did face a minor challenge in deciding what additional columns to add. I initially considered adding columns for "Blocked" or "Testing," but ultimately settled on **Ready**, **In Progress**, **In Review**, and **Done** for simplicity. The only real challenge was organizing the backlog, prioritizing the issues, and ensuring that the board reflected the real progress of the tasks.

## Comparison with Other Tools
GitHub’s project templates offer a simple and effective way to manage tasks, but when compared with tools like **Trello** or **Jira**, there are some differences in features. For instance, **Trello** is highly customizable with an easy drag-and-drop interface and is often used for personal or team project management. However, **Jira** offers more sophisticated tools for tracking time, resources, and detailed reporting, which is useful in larger, more complex projects.

GitHub’s **Automated Kanban** template is better suited for small to medium-sized projects where simplicity and integration with the GitHub Issues workflow are priorities. Unlike **Trello**, GitHub integrates directly with repositories, which makes it easy to track tasks, pull requests, and issues all in one place. However, it lacks some of the advanced reporting and time-tracking features found in **Jira**.

## Reflection on the Kanban Board and Agile
Using the Kanban board to manage tasks in this project has been a helpful experience in understanding Agile principles. It made the workflow very clear and helped me visualize the progress of tasks from **Backlog** to **Done**. The board’s ability to show the status of each issue, whether **In Progress** or **In Review**, allowed me
