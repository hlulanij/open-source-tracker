Reflection for Assignment 8: Object State Modeling and Activity Workflow Modeling
Challenges Encountered:

One of the major challenges I faced while completing Assignment 8 was learning how to properly create and integrate state transition and activity workflow diagrams using Mermaid. Initially, rendering the diagrams in GitHub’s markdown format proved to be tricky due to parsing errors, which slowed down the process. However, after a bit of troubleshooting, I learned the correct syntax and structure for Mermaid diagrams, which allowed me to successfully render the diagrams within my repository.

Another challenge was ensuring that the state transition diagrams accurately represented the system behavior in a logical flow. Each state and transition had to be clearly defined, considering the system’s operations and the user's interactions. Mapping out the states for user account management, contribution tracking, and report generation required a detailed understanding of the system’s functionality, and at times, I had to revise my diagrams to ensure the flows were correct.

Lessons Learned:

This assignment reinforced the importance of clear, visual representations of system behavior. The state transition diagrams helped me organize the various stages of the user account lifecycle, the data fetching process, and the report generation workflow. It became clear that breaking down complex systems into smaller, manageable steps in the form of state transitions and activities is an excellent way to visualize and communicate how a system should behave in response to various events.

I also learned more about using GitHub's support for Mermaid diagrams and how it can help simplify the process of documenting technical workflows in a project. It’s essential to understand the limitations and quirks of the platform when rendering diagrams, which I discovered through trial and error.

Future Considerations:

In future assignments, I plan to approach diagram creation earlier in the design process. While I initially focused on functional development, the visual representation of system behavior helped clarify the relationships between components and user actions. Going forward, I will continue using tools like Mermaid for quick diagramming and documentation, ensuring that system states and activities are outlined early on to aid in both development and communication with stakeholders.

Additionally, I aim to improve the clarity and depth of my diagrams by adding more details about edge cases and system exceptions, which will provide a more robust view of the system's behavior.
