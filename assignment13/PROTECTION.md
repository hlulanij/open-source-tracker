# Branch Protection Rules

These rules are enabled to maintain code quality, encourage collaboration, and avoid accidental issues in production.

## Rules Applied to `main` Branch:
- âœ… All code must go through a Pull Request
- âœ… At least one reviewer must approve each PR
- âœ… All status checks (CI tests) must pass before merging
- âœ… Direct pushes to `main` are blocked to avoid accidental changes
- âœ… Optional: Administrators must also follow these rules

## Why This Matters:
- ðŸ”’ Prevents broken or untested code from being merged into `main`
- ðŸ‘¥ Encourages team collaboration through PR reviews
- ðŸ§ª Ensures CI workflows validate the code before it goes live
- ðŸ“ˆ Builds trust and stability in the project over time
