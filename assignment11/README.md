# Assignment 11: Implementing a Persistence Repository Layer

## ‚úÖ Objective
This assignment implements a persistence layer for storing domain entities using the Repository design pattern and abstraction via a factory mechanism.

## üìÅ Project Structure

## ‚úÖ Design Justification

- **Generic Repository Interface**:  
  We used generics in the `Repository<T, ID>` interface to avoid duplication across different entity repositories (e.g. `BookRepository`).

- **In-Memory Implementation**:  
  CRUD operations are implemented using a `HashMap`, allowing fast prototyping.

- **Factory Pattern for Abstraction**:  
  A `RepositoryFactory` decouples the service from storage logic, enabling future switching to JSON, SQL, or API storage with minimal changes.

---

## üîç Example Usage

Run `Main.java` to:

- Add books to the repository
- Read a book by ID
- View all books
- Delete a book

## üìå Backlog / Issues

- [x] Create a generic `Repository<T, ID>` interface
- [x] Create entity-specific `BookRepository` interface
- [x] Implement `InMemoryBookRepository` using `HashMap`
- [x] Create a `RepositoryFactory` to abstract storage choice
- [x] Demonstrate usage in `Main.java`
- [ ] Future: Add FileSystem (JSON/XML) storage backend
- [ ] Future: Add SQL/NoSQL storage options (MySQL, MongoDB)
- [ ] Future: Add external API-based repository option

## üß† Reflections

This modular design ensures high flexibility, low coupling, and easy testability. By abstracting the storage logic, the system remains open to extension but closed to modification ‚Äî following SOLID principles.
