# Assignment 10 – System Specification Document

## 📌 Project Title
Open Source Tracker

## 🌐 Domain Description
This project falls within the domain of software engineering, developer productivity, and data visualization. It focuses on helping developers track and analyze their contributions to open-source projects in a meaningful, structured way.

## 🚩 Problem Statement
Open-source contributors often struggle to visualize and quantify their impact over time. While platforms like GitHub provide statistics, there is a lack of personalized tools to track specific contributions, understand commit patterns, and reflect on personal growth as a developer.

## 🎯 Purpose and Scope of the System
The purpose of this system is to:
- Track contributions (commits) made by a user to various repositories.
- Summarize contribution history per project and overall.
- Offer simple visual and textual summaries.
- Help developers reflect on their activity and improve contribution habits.

**Scope includes:**
- Tracking repositories and commits.
- Storing user contribution data.
- Providing summary statistics and potential graphs.
- Easy access to a user’s development history.

**Scope excludes:**
- Real-time syncing with GitHub API (handled manually or simulated).
- Deep analytics or ML-based suggestions.
- Team management and collaborative features.

## 👩‍💻 Individual Scope and Feasibility
The scope is limited to a single-user use case for simplicity. The system will be implemented using Markdown documentation, class diagrams (Mermaid.js), and basic data organization. There are no external dependencies, making it suitable for academic purposes.

**Feasibility Justification:**
- The system does not require complex infrastructure.
- No backend or database integration is needed at this stage.
