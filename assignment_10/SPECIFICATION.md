# System Specification Document

## üìå Project Title
**Open Source Tracker System**

## üåç Domain Description
This system falls under the **Software Development** and **Developer Productivity** domains. It helps individual developers and contributors track their open-source contributions across various repositories.

## ‚ùì Problem Statement
Many students and aspiring developers contribute to open-source projects but lack a centralized way to track, measure, or reflect on their work. This makes it difficult to showcase contributions when applying for internships, jobs, or funding opportunities.

## üéØ Objectives
- Provide users with a profile to log contributions.
- Automatically track contributions (commits, repositories).
- Summarize statistics (e.g., most active days, repos contributed to).
- Enable users to update their profile.
- Store and retrieve contribution history efficiently.

## üßç Individual Scope
This system is a **solo-developed** mini-tracker aimed at helping students visualize and manage their GitHub contributions without needing to access or connect to the GitHub API.

### Features Implemented:
- Class diagram defining `User`, `Contribution`, `Repository`, `Commit`, and `Tracker` entities.
- Internal structure to log and display contribution data.
- Designed with expandability and offline usage in mind.

## ‚úÖ Justification (Feasibility)
- Does not rely on external APIs or live GitHub integration, so it works offline.
- Simple data models allow for easy simulation or manual entry of contributions.
- Designed with learning goals in mind (data structures, class design, GitHub documentation, and diagramming).
