# Kanban Board Explanation

## What is a Kanban Board?
A Kanban board is a visual tool used to manage tasks and track their progress across different stages of development.

## Workflow Visualization
- **Backlog**: Tasks that are planned but not started.
- **Ready**: Tasks ready to be worked on.
- **In Progress**: Tasks currently being worked on.
- **In Review**: Tasks waiting for feedback or testing.
- **Done**: Completed tasks.

## Work-In-Progress (WIP) Limits
We limit the number of tasks in progress to avoid bottlenecks and ensure tasks are completed before new ones are started.

## Agile Principles
- **Continuous Delivery**: Tasks move from one column to the next as they are completed.
- **Adaptability**: Tasks can be re-prioritized and moved between columns as needed.
- **Collaboration**: The board makes it easy to see who is working on what and facilitates team communication.
