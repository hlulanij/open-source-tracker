## Justification for Selected Template

I selected the **Automated Kanban** template for my project because it includes built-in automation that aligns with the Agile sprint planning process. The automated moving of issues based on their status helps streamline workflow management and ensures the team can track task progress effectively. This templateâ€™s features are well-suited for small to medium-sized projects that follow Agile principles of continuous progress and adaptability.
